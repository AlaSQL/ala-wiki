# How to release a new version of AlaSQL

AlaSQL uses [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) to manage development and [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to manage versioning. 
**In practice the result is that the master branch is never updated without updating the version number.**
That includes changes like corrections to documentation files such as README.md. 

The formatting of this document is a bit funny because it works both as a markdown document and a `sh` script. Running the command
```sh
> npm run release
```
will `curl` the content of this wiki page to `sh`.
